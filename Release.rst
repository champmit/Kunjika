Release 0.1 Alpha
-----------------

Kunjika 0.1 alpha is being released today. Note that it is in very early stages
today and things may break very bad. Please open issues at
`its support website <https://kunjika.libreprogramming.org>`_. Please note that
to not have unknown signing autthority you need to import cacert's root certificate
in your browser. The site will be on by EST end of day today.

I am working on documentation and will be available at
`libreprogramming website <http://libreprogrammig/docs/Kunjika>`_.

Please note that you can use to implement a testing site but do not use in production
because a lot more features are to come and things will break compatibility.

Happy seeking knowledge.

It is online now. Documentation has some issues which I will fix soon.
