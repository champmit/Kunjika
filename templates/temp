    "description": "Kunjika is a clone of [Stack Overflow][1]. The first alpha (version 0.1) was released a few days ago and this demo site was set up to help people see what it is and what it has to offer.\r\n\r\nIt is a Free software project released under the GPL license, and coding is being done by just one person, so help is needed. The base features are in place and work quite well,  but there are many more features yet to be implemented. \r\n\r\nIf you are a code ninja, and are familiar with the Flask framwork (and Python), Couchbase and memcached, feel free to jump in and contribute code. The project is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/shivshankardayal/Kunjika.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of features, in order of priority, that need attention. Feel free to work on any that you can contribute code for, regardless of the order it appears in this listing.\r\n\r\n 1. Built-in Web Application Firewall (WAF) and IDS/IPS system\r\n 2. Automatic site upgrade check and 1-click site upgrade\r\n 3. Automatic site and DB backup, with backup scheduling to remote or cloud server\r\n 4. Ability to take site offline (maintenance mode)\r\n 5. Banning IP/IP range\r\n 6. Akismet or Defensio anti-spam integration\r\n 7. Built-in website scanner to scan template files for malware and unauthorized modifications, with email notification to admin to report suspected modifications\r\n 8. Login Security & Monitoring (notify admin when a user with admin privileges logs in, etc)\r\n 9. \"Similar question\" feature just like Stack Overflow\r\n 10. Make a sticky post\r\n 11. Implement a Category system, with the option to add a post to multiple categories (no more than 2, but configurable by admin). Also, a popular categories tag.\r\n 12. Sending private messages between registered members, and email notification when a private message is received\r\n 13. Users can receive an email when someone quotes them, replies to their posts, or mentions their @username\r\n 14. Create private discussion group\r\n 15. Visual notification of new questions/comments/answers when a user is browsing any part of the forum. e.g \"A new question/comment/answer has been posted, click here to read it.\" Or \"4 new questions/comments/answers have just been posted. Click here to read them.\"\r\n 16. Ability to embed video and audio links that will be *in situ*.\r\n 17. Backup core files to a locked down directory, with the ability to restore modified files to the originals from this directory\r\n 18. Admin can create an announcement post that is then broadcast by email to all registered users. Give users the option to opt out of such messages from their profile page\r\n 19. Related questions tag that embeds related questions at the end of a discussion\r\n 20. Blog module, with a liveblogging feature similar to ScribbleLive\r\n 21. Gallery module to enable creation of a gallery page (a blog for galleries)\r\n 22. Chat, just like Stack Overflow, that only users with a certain reputation may participate in, or any registered member may join\r\n 23. WordPress module, to embed Kunjika forum in a WP site\r\n 24. Users can send invitation emails from their profile page\r\n 25. When Gallery and blog module are in place, make it possible for site admins to choose the site;s landing page - QA Forum, Blog, or Gallery\r\n\r\nThese are what we can think of at this time, so feel free to request a feature, report bugs, or contribute code. When reporting a feature,  use the **feature** tag. Use **bugs** when reporting a bug, or bugs.\r\n\r\nSo, go ahead.
